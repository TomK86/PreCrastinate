Testing PreCrastinate
=====================

Precrastinate is tested using JUnit - a simple framework for writing repeatable unit tests. In order to test this code, the user must have previously installed Eclipse and the Eclipse Android Emulator. Testing may be done within Eclipse by following these steps:
- Expand the desired project in the Package Explorer.
- Select the desired testing file located in the project directory at *PreCrastinate* -> *testing* -> *com.csci3308.precrastinate*.
- Go to Run the Project at *Run* -> *Run as* -> *Android JUnit Test*. This will launch the Android Emulator and run the test file.
- Upon completion of the testing, the *JUnit* view will appear in the Eclipse window with the testing results.
..- If *JUnit* view does not appear in the Eclipse window, it can be opened by selecting *Window* -> *Show View* -> *Other...*. This will open the *Show View* wizard, where you will select *Java* -> *JUnit* and select *OK*.
